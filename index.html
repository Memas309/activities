      <td colspan="2"><h2>Where Is Dwayne Johnson From?</h2>
       Dwayne Douglas Johnson was born on May 2, 1972, in Hayward, California, to Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Bowles) and Ata Maivia Johnson. His father, a professional wrestler, was Black Nova Scotian and his mother is of Samoan descent. When Johnson was born, his father was married to another woman, but his parents later wed when he was 5 years old. Though he had two older half-siblings, Curtis and Wanda Bowles, he was raised as an only child.
          
         rowing up, Johnson frequently moved around to accommodate Rocky’s pro wrestling career, attending a new school nearly every year. In his early years, he lived in upward of 13 states, including North Carolina, Connecticut, Hawaii, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. “I spent a lot of my childhood in the back seat of a car just driving from town to town as my dad would wrestle,” Johnson recalled to GQ in November 2024. This nomadic lifestyle led him to struggle in school, earning poor grades. It also caused his family to struggle financially, leading to periods of poverty.
          
          
          With his father seldom at home, Johnson looked up to his maternal grandfather, pro wrestler Peter “High Chief” Fanene Maivia, for guidance. After Maivia died of cancer, however, Johnson started acting out. When Johnson was 13 years old, he moved to Auckland, New Zealand, to live with his mother’s family before returning to the United States the following year. By age 14, he was living with his mother in a small apartment in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he briefly attended William McKinley high school. It was around this time that he started stealing and getting into trouble.
          
          “I was a very angry teenager,” he told British GQ in November 2016. “I didn’t like my parents fighting, my dad being on the road, not making much money. It was tough...and I was getting into a lot of fights.” His time in Hawaii soon came to end, however, when he and his mother were abruptly evicted from their home. Following the eviction, they moved in with his father in Memphis, Tennessee. It was also around this time that he began lifting weights and gaining muscle mass.
          
     At age 15, Johnson’s family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he attended Freedom High School for two years. Though he continued to get into fights and even got arrested for theft, he also channeled his aggression into football. Johnson graduated high school in 1990 and went on to play college football at the University of Miami, showing promise with his size and athleticism until being slowed by injuries. After consulting with his coaches, he refocused his efforts on his academics, eventually earning a bachelor's degree in criminology and physiology in 1995. That same year, Johnson tried his hand at professional football when he was signed to the Canadian Football League’s Calgary Stampeders but was soon cut from the team after just two months.</td>
      <td colspan="2"><h2>Becoming “The Rock” </h2>
     
        With few prospects left in football, Johnson turned to professional wrestling, following in his father and grandfather’s footsteps. He began wrestling in a few non-televised matches in early 1996, defeating the Brooklyn Brawler in a house show that March. After a couple of matches, Johnson made his debut in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) under the name Flex Kavana in May, winning a tag team championship with Bart Sawyer.
          
          He soon signed a contract with the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), debuting as Rocky Maivia that November at the WWE’s Survivor Series. After his “good guy” character proved unsuccessful, however, he pivoted, turning into a villainous heel when he joined The Nation of Domination in August 1997. Johnson eventually took over the wrestling group’s leadership and began calling himself “The Rock.” He later joined another band of elite wrestlers known as “The Corporation” and began a notorious feud with Steve Austin. Also known as “The People’s Champ,” The Rock went on to win a combined 17 WWE titles over his acclaimed career.
          
          Johnson stopped wrestling full-time in 2004 to focus on his acting, before returning part-time in 2011 to create a feuding storyline with John Cena. He wrestled his last full match against Cena in at WrestleMania 29 in April 2013, which he lost. Johnson later competed in a six-second match against Eric Rowan in 2016 at WrestleMania 32, quickly winning with his signature moves The Rock Bottom and the People’s Elbows. After going three years with no matches, he announced his official retirement from wrestling in 2019.
          
          
      Johnson later made a surprise appearance at Friday Night Smackdown in September 2023 and joined the board of directors of WWE’s parent company TKO the following January. In an interview with LADbible in November 2024, he explained wrestling “provided me a platform and a way to express myself in ways that nothing else would allow,” aside from his acting career. “So the opportunity for me to become a director, sit on the board, take that position, is just another way that I could help the company grow,” Johnson said. He has since made several more appearances, notably competing in a tag team match with Roman Reigns at 2024’s WrestleMania XL.</td>
